# Dear Future Me

I hope you are happy.

I hope you are well.

I hope you don’t despair every night like you used to.

I hope you got your life figured out (for the most part).

I hope you are more kind, thoughtful, loving, caring, humble, successful, and grateful than you were before.

I hope everything goes well for you, even if there are bumps and turns along the way. I hope you still love and care for your family and friends like you used to, especially for the little orange guy. Honestly I wouldn’t mind if you haven’t found a significant other yet, as long as you’re happy with how you are.

I hope you’re happy with your job, the you in the past certainly had no fucking idea what he really wanted to do.

I hope you’ve found meaning in things, and that existence is not dreadful and unbearable as it used to be.

I know you will still be listening to the same songs, that’s just who you are, you sentimental little shit.

I know you will still overthink everything, it doesn’t make you better than anyone though.

I know you will still have faith in life.

I know you will still be alive.
